# neurosonics-website

This is the beginnings of a website about a music project of mine. I used Foundation to assemble a responsive grid, with each cell containing information about each work in the series.
* Each cell contains embedded audio or video that adjusts responsively.
* I'm working towards using event listeners to expand each cell, revealing more information and media about each work in multiple stages.
* The responsive links at the top are musicians who have collaborated with me on the project!
